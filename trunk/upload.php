For your crop you should:
- Make a copy of the full size original
- Scale down or up this image so it fits in the browser nicely
- When the crop occurs we will take the coordinates (in relation 
  to the scaled image) and perform the same crop on the full size.
  This helps maintain the quality of the image.  The more an image 
  is resized the worse the quality becomes.
